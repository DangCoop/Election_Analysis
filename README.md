# **Election_Analysis**
## **Overview of Election Audit**
___
A company that successfully held elections in some states turned to us for help. Before us was the task of a complete audit of the elections. This analysis allows you to compare the received data with previous periods for a better understanding of issues such as:
The turnout of voters by districts, the correct construction of the election campaign, the possibility of falsification, the prediction of results, and this is not the whole list!

+ Total number of votes each candidate received
+ Percentage of votes each candidate won
